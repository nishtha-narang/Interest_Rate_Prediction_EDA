# 📊 Interest Rate Prediction – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on understanding a loan dataset through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using **Python**. The goal is to explore the data, find useful patterns, and prepare it for future machine learning models that predict **interest rates**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 What I Did

- ✅ Loaded and explored the dataset
- ✅ Cleaned missing values and removed outliers
- ✅ Visualized data using graphs (boxplots, bar plots)
- ✅ Found relationships between borrower features and interest rates
- ✅ Prepared the cleaned data for modeling

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Build a machine learning model to predict interest rates  
- Fine-tune model performance using the insights gained from EDA
